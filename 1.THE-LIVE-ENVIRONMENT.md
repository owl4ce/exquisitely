## 1. Pre-installation

### 1.1 Acquire Artix installation image

Choose `#! base` stable ISO image on Artix Linux [Download](https://artixlinux.org/download.php#official) page depending
on your preferred init system. On this page, OpenRC will be used as default.

### 1.2 Prepare an installation media

It is suggested to use [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/doc_news.html) if you **already** have hybrid installation
media (with many DATA included) such as External SSDs. Use [balenaEtcher](https://etcher-docs.balena.io/) or similiar
tool otherwise.

### 1.3 Boot the live environment

> Ensure to **disable** Secure Boot on firmware settings. On this page, UEFI system is used.

Open boot menu by pressing a key during POST and point to your installation media, or set the firmware's boot
priority/menu. Refer to your Vendor for details. On GRUB menu, optionally configure according to your needs and select
"From CD/DVD/ISO: artix.x86_64". Login as root.

### 1.4 Connect to the internet

1. Ensure the network interface is known.

```sh
ip link
```

2. For wireless connection, WLAN card shall not blocked and enabled.

```sh
rfkill unblock wlan
```
```sh
ip link set wlan0 up
```

3. Plug the ethernet cable, or authenticate to wireless network.

```bash
wpa_supplicant -B -i wlan0 -c <(wpa_passphrase 'SSID' 'WPA2-PSK_PASSWORD')
```

4. Configure your network connection, DHCP is preferred.

```sh
dhcpcd
```

5. Verify the internet connection, usually with ping.

```sh
ping artixlinux.org
```

### 1.5 Update the system clock

Activate the NTP daemon to synchronize the computer's real-time clock.

```sh
rc-service ntpd start
```

### 1.6 Partition the disks

Linux kernel uses block device such as `/dev/sda` for SATA and USB flash drive, `/dev/nvme0n1` for NVMe, and
`/dev/mmcblk0` for MMC/eMMC. To identify these devices, use lsblk or fdisk.

```sh
lsblk -f
```
```sh
fdisk -l
```

> If your NVMe devices not detected, you may try **permanently disable** Intel VMD on firmware settings. Either words,
RAID mode is not allowed. On this page, NVMe SSD is used.

The following partition scenario are **needed** for a chosen device:
- Main partition for the `/` (root) file system, and
- EFI system partition (ESP) to store kernel and initial RAM file system.

Use a partitioning tool like cfdisk to modify the partition table.

```sh
cfdisk /dev/nvme0n1
```

#### 1.6.1 Partition table

| Mount point | Partition | Type | Suggested size |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `/` | `/dev/nvme0n1p2` | Linux filesystem | At least 20GB |
| `/boot/` | `/dev/nvme0n1p1` | EFI System | Over 100MB |
| `/media/Butter/` | `/dev/nvme0n1p3` | Linux filesystem | OPTIONAL FOR DISCRETE DATA |

### 1.7 Format the partitions

#### 1.7.1 Root file system

Once the partitions have been created, each newly created partition must be formatted with an appropriate file system.
Flash-Friendly File System (F2FS) is preferred file system as uses SSD.

```sh
mkfs.f2fs -l 'Artix Linux' -O extra_attr,inode_checksum,flexible_inline_xattr,inode_crtime,verity,sb_checksum,compression /dev/nvme0n1p2
```

#### 1.7.2 EFI system partition

If you created an EFI system partition, format it to FAT32.

> ESP must not be formatted if you **already** use other OS such as dual-booting Microsoft Windows. Resizing ESP on GPT
system as suggested size requires advanced effort; [AOMEI Partition Assistant](https://www.diskpart.com/) is suggested
over any tools.

```sh
mkfs.fat -F 32 /dev/nvme0n1p1
```

#### 1.7.3 Discrete data partition

As per the [partition table](#161-partition-table) above, below is optional. Use Better File System (BtrFS) for discrete
data partition from the main/root file system.

> BtrFS as the name suggest is chosen because if you are dual-booting Microsoft Windows,
[WinBtrfs](https://github.com/maharmstone/btrfs) is available to install on Windows system.

```sh
mkfs.btrfs -L Butter -O extref,skinny-metadata /dev/nvme0n1p3
```

### 1.8 Mount the file systems

Mount the root file system to `/mnt/`.

```sh
mount -o rw,noatime,gc_merge,inline_xattr,flush_merge,data_flush,checkpoint_merge,compress_algorithm=lz4,compress_extension=*,compress_chksum,compress_cache,atgc,age_extent_cache /dev/nvme0n1p2 /mnt/
```

Mount the ESP to `/mnt/boot/`.

```sh
mount --mkdir -o noatime /dev/nvme0n1p1 /mnt/boot/
```

Mount the discrete data partition to `/mnt/media/Butter/`.

> The creation of `/mnt/media/` as a mount directory instead of `/mnt/mnt/` is solely to satisfy Gnome Virtual File
System (GVFS), to display the partition on the graphical file manager later.

```sh
mount --mkdir -o rw,noatime,autodefrag,commit=15,compress-force=zstd:7 /dev/nvme0n1p3 /mnt/media/Butter/
```

## 2. Installation

### 2.1 Base system

Use basestrap to install the base, base-devel package groups, and your preferred init system.

```sh
basestrap /mnt/ base base-devel openrc elogind-openrc
```

### 2.2 Linux kernel

There are three kernels Artix provides: linux, linux-lts, and linux-zen. On this page, linux-zen is preferred for
balanced optimization and linux-firmware for compatibility fixes.

```sh
basetrap /mnt/ linux-zen linux-firmware
```

## 3. Configure the system

### 3.1 Fstab

Generate a fstab file.

```sh
fstabgen -U /mnt/ >> /mnt/etc/fstab
```

As uses GPT system, partitions should be mounted persistently by PARTUUID. Use blkid to generate identifiers and append
to fstab file.

```sh
blkid >> /mnt/etc/fstab
```

Check the resulting `/mnt/etc/fstab` file, edit it in case of errors and remove the output generated by blkid at the
end.

```sh
${EDITOR:-nano} /mnt/etc/fstab
``` 

#### 3.1.1 File system table

Due to F2FS remount problems with some options, remove `flush_merge,compress_cache,atgc,age_extent_cache` from fstab
file. Those options must be placed as kernel parameter on the [first-mount](#37-bootloader-less). The content of
`/mnt/etc/fstab` file should looks like this.

```
# Static information about the filesystems.
# See fstab(5) for details.

# <file system> <dir> <type> <options> <dump> <pass>
# /dev/nvme0n1p2 LABEL=Artix\134x20Linux
PARTUUID=a8d18ea3-a488-4362-bbe1-92f6e821689d	/         	f2fs      	rw,noatime,gc_merge,inline_xattr,data_flush,checkpoint_merge,compress_algorithm=lz4,compress_extension=*,compress_chksum	0 1

# /dev/nvme0n1p1
PARTUUID=166dd973-e7d1-4890-be94-48a93c1b719b      	/boot     	vfat      	rw,noatime,fmask=0022,dmask=0022,codepage=437,iocharset=ascii,shortname=mixed,utf8,errors=remount-ro	0 2

# /dev/nvme0n1p3
PARTUUID=a429b7f1-7541-4a1b-bff8-ccaa1445d13c		/media/Butter	btrfs		rw,noatime,autodefrag,commit=15,compress-force=zstd:7	0 0
```

### 3.2 Chroot

Change root into the new Artix system.

```sh
artix-chroot /mnt/
```

### 3.3 Time

Set the time zone.

```sh
ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/YOUR_REGION/YOUR_CITY /etc/localtime
```

Run hwclock to synchronize RTC from system local time.

```sh
hwclock --systohc
```

> If you are dual-booting Microsoft Windows, apply `RealTimeIsUniversal` registry tweak to assume RTC is UTC in Windows
system (as Linux system does).

### 3.4 Localization

Install a text editor of your choice

```sh
pacman -S nano vim
```

and uncomment the locales such as `en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8` in `/etc/locale.gen`, as your desire.

```sh
nano /etc/locale.gen
```

Generate the locales.

```sh
locale-gen
```

Set the systemwide locale by exporting LANG environment variable.

```sh
echo 'export LANG=en_US.UTF-8' > /etc/locale.conf
```

### 3.5 Network configuration

Create and set the hostname file.

```sh
echo 'YOUR_HOSTNAME' > /etc/hostname
```

Match the hosts file.

```sh
cat >> /etc/hosts << "EOL"
127.0.0.1    localhost
::1          localhost
127.0.1.1    YOUR_HOSTNAME.localdomain    YOUR_HOSTNAME
EOL
```

> If your system has a permanent IP address, it should be used instead of 127.0.1.1.

If you want to use DHCP configuration, install a DHCP client and for wireless connection too. Iwd and dhcpcd is
preferred as its simplicity.

```sh
pacman -S dhcpcd dhcpcd-openrc iwd iwd-openrc
```

Add dhcpcd and iwd OpenRC service to default runlevel.

```sh
rc-update add dhcpcd iwd default
```

### 3.6 Initramfs

#### 3.6.1 Essential settings

Edit the mkinitcpio configuration to debloat unneeded features in initial RAM file system.

```sh
nano /etc/mkinitpio.conf
```

##### 3.6.1.1 HOOKS

The HOOKS control modules and scripts added into initramfs image, and here is the essential to include.

```
...

HOOKS=(base udev autodetect microcode modconf kms block filesystems)

...
```

##### 3.6.1.2 COMPRESSION

For balanced optimization between decompression speed and size, set the COMPRESSION algorithm to LZ4.

```
...

COMPRESSION="lz4"

...
```

#### 3.6.2 Essential presets

Remove and comment out unneeded fallback preset from linux-zen mkinitcpio preset file.

```sh
nano /etc/mkinitcpio.d/linux-zen.preset
```

The configuration should looks like this.

```
# mkinitcpio preset file for the 'linux-zen' package

#ALL_config="/etc/mkinitcpio.conf"
ALL_kver="/boot/vmlinuz-linux-zen"

PRESETS=('default')

#default_config="/etc/mkinitcpio.conf"
default_image="/boot/initramfs-linux-zen.img"
#default_uki="/efi/EFI/Linux/arch-linux-zen.efi"
#default_options="--splash /usr/share/systemd/bootctl/splash-arch.bmp"

#fallback_config="/etc/mkinitcpio.conf"
#fallback_image="/boot/initramfs-linux-zen-fallback.img"
#fallback_uki="/efi/EFI/Linux/arch-linux-zen-fallback.efi"
#fallback_options="-S autodetect"
```

#### 3.6.3 Image recreation

After unneeded settings have been debloated, recreate the initramfs image.

```sh
mkinitcpio -P
```

### 3.7 Bootloader(-less)

Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) is designed to remove the need for an intermediate bootloader. Thus, Linux
kernel is a valid EFI executable which can be directly launched from UEFI (boot menu). Firstly, install efibootmgr that
will be used to interact with UEFI NVRAM.

```sh
pacman -S efivar efibootmgr
```

Create a **respective** boot entry to all configurations.

```sh
efibootmgr -c -d /dev/nvme0n1 -p 1 -L 'Artix Linux-Zen' -l /vmlinuz-linux-zen -u 'root=PARTUUID=a8d18ea3-a488-4362-bbe1-92f6e821689d rw rootflags=atgc,age_extent_cache,flush_merge,compress_cache loglevel=3 initrd=\initramfs-linux-zen.img'
```

## 4. System administration

### 4.1 Users and groups

Set the privileged user (root) password before creating unprivileged user account.

```sh
passwd
```

Unprivileged user is general and secure for most tasks. Create an user and add it to wheel group to performs partial
administrative actions.

```sh
useradd -m -G wheel YOUR_USER
```

Set the unprivileged user password.

```sh
passwd YOUR_USER
```

### 4.2 Privilege elevation

#### 4.2.1 Sudo

Allow users of group wheel to execute command as another user such as root.

```sh
EDITOR=nano visudo
```

Uncomment below line containing ALL belongs to wheel group.

```
...

## Uncomment to allow members of group wheel to execute any command
%wheel ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

...
```

#### 4.2.2 Doas

Alternative to sudo, install opendoas if you are familiar with OpenBSD doas.

```sh
pacman -S opendoas
```

Create a configuration file to allow users of group wheel to execute command as another user such as root.

```sh
echo 'permit persist setenv {PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin} :wheel' > /etc/doas.conf
```

Ensure the owner and group of `/etc/doas.conf` file should both be 0 (root)

```sh
chown -c root:root /etc/doas.conf
```

and file permissions should be secured to 0400.

```sh
chmod -c 0400 /etc/doas.conf
```

#### 4.2.3 Polkit

Polkit is used to control systemwide privileges. It provides an organized way for non-privileged processes to
communicate with privileged ones. It does not grant as another user such as root to an entire process, but rather allows
a finer level of control of centralized system policy. Hence, install polkit for sane environment.

```sh
pacman -S polkit
```

## 5. Package management

### 5.1 Repositories

Enable Arch repositories to cover packages that not yet available in Artix repositories. Install artix-archlinux-support

```sh
pacman -S artix-archlinux-support
```

and append extra repositories to pacman configuration file.

```sh
cat >> /etc/pacman.conf << "EOL"

[extra]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist-arch
EOL
```

Populate the pacman key.

```sh
pacman-key --populate archlinux
```

Performs system upgrade.

```sh
pacman -Syu
```

## 6. Reboot

Exit the chroot environment or press *Ctrl+d*.

```sh
exit
```

Unmount all mounted partitions.

```sh
umount -R /mnt/
```

Reboot the live environment

```sh
reboot
```

and boot to [**The Art of Linux**](./2.THE-ART-OF-LINUX.md).
