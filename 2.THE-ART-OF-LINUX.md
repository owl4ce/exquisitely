## PREFACE

In environmental ambivalence or betterly known as to-day, is a beautiful example of strong determinism. From technology,
by technology, for technology in principle. Those who just woke up are exchanging themselves for technology. Not because
of love, but because they have no free will. I would like to emphasize here, the technology itself does not have free
will. Therefore, why the common one have no free will and become the virtual ouroboros?

Instead of expressing thought through an interface, society commonly impressing themselves by an interface. They bite
their own tails by misidentifying themselves. Which eventually causes stress and confusion. Even worse, beautifully
inhumane. Not the technology causes it all, but technology consent it all. The problem is impractical, this is a
time-less culture. *By the technology, human potentially utilize other human as a technology.*

Skills and measures such as intelligence and creativity are useless. They are only useful if whoever is being measured
conforms to the ideals of society, or precisely systemic culture. For example, if a student is required to master a
technology, while the technology is too complicated. Consequently, the student simply hand it over to those they call
"experts". When chaos ensues, where does their intelligence and creativity measure up?

If they do not conform to the ideals, they will be marginalized from society. Nevertheless, they are all free from
society. When we are truly FREE TO CHOOSE the technology we use, we are also free to determine ourselves towards
society. They are not wrong, but we are wrong simply because we obey society rather than our own conscience.

From the swirls of infinite words, this is based on my flowery and private experiences. I am not an expert, and there
are no things such as "experts". Those are just labelling system and no further explanation, as I said *before*. I
wrote this is to articulate my latent ideas, while developing them within this.

This web-book is divided into the following parts.

1. [**The Live Environment**](./1.THE-LIVE-ENVIRONMENT.md)  
   Parts 1 orchestrating step-by-step of installing Artix Linux on desired machine with ease, accountable.
2. [**The Art of Linux**](#readme)  
   Parts 2 guides the reader why and how to create an art through modular technology such as Linux system.
