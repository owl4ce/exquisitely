## I. PREFACE

In environmental ambivalence, call it time-less culture is a beautiful example of strong determinism. Someone who just
woke up, exchanging themselves for technology not because they love it, but because they have no free will. From
technology, by technology, for technology is real chain of chaos. I would like to emphasize, not because I hate
technology, but because the technology itself does not have free will. Why the common one have no free will?

This is how strong determinism comes true. Instead of expressing thought through an interface, society commonly
impressing themselves by an interface. From here, looks like ouroboros biting its own tail due to misidentifying itself.
Which will eventually causes stress and confusion, even worse, beautifully inhumane. Should humankind destroy their
technologies? No. They have to destroy their culture by emphasizing themselves that they CAN CHOOSE a technology.
