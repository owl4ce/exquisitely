# PREFACE

In environmental ambivalence or betterly known as to-day, is a beautiful example of strong determinism. From technology,
by technology, for technology in principle. Those who just woke up are exchanging themselves for technology. Not because
of love, but because they have no free will. I would like to emphasize here, the technology itself does not have free
will. Therefore, why the common one have no free will and become the virtual ouroboros?

Instead of expressing thought through an interface, society commonly impressing themselves by an interface. They bite
their own tails by misidentifying themselves. Which eventually causes stress and confusion. Even worse, beautifully
inhumane. Not the technology causes it all, but technology consent it all. The problem is impractical, this is a
time-less culture. *By the technology, human potentially utilize other human as a technology.*

Skills and measures such as intelligence and creativity are useless. They are only useful if whoever is being measured
conforms to the ideals of society, or precisely systemic culture. For example, if a student is required to master a
technology, while the technology is too complicated. Consequently, the student simply hand it over to those they call
"experts". When chaos ensues, where does their intelligence and creativity measure up?

If they do not conform to the ideals, they will be marginalized from society. Nevertheless, they are free from society
and they do not even will for it. *Even if I fail in pursuing something, I AM STILL FREE.* When we are truly FREE TO
CHOOSE something we will use, we are truly free to determine ourselves towards society. They are not wrong, but we are
wrong simply because we obey society rather than our own conscience. Mine may be different from yours, but I have spent
my entire life to contemplate my surroundings.

From the fragrance of Jasminum sambac, to the swirls of infinite words. I am not an expert, and there are no things such
as "experts". Those are just labelling system and no further explanation, as I said *before*. I wrote this is to
articulate my latent ideas, while developing them within this. Forgive me if I am wrong, I could not find an effective
and efficient solution other than by education with this.

This web-book is divided into the following parts.

0. [**Thy Pad Never Thinks**](./0.THY-PAD-NEVER-THINKS.md) (metadocument)  
   Parts 0 exposes the author's choice about machine flexibility and quality with the next step taken.
1. [**The Live Environment**](./1.THE-LIVE-ENVIRONMENT.md)  
   Parts 1 orchestrating steps of installing Artix Linux on desired machine with ease and accountable.
2. [**The Art of Linux**](#the-art-of-linux)  
   Parts 2 guides the reader why or how to create art with modular technology such as Linux system.

If questioning "Why Artix Linux?", then there will be endless questions and answers just because it is the predication
of "The **Art** of **Linux**". Keeping the "why" will only deceive yourself, the question should be changed to "How do I
solve my predetermined problem?". And from it, I can learn from myself and not just pay for services or any
materialistic exchange. This is where intellect, creativity, and wisdom emerge.

# THE ART OF LINUX

After successfully completing the installation in and through The Live Environment, you should boot to "Artix Linux-Zen"
by opening boot menu during POST, or set the firmware's boot priority/menu to set it as default boot. Next, normally we
should login as unprivileged user.

## An Initiative Action

### Manual Pages

Every action is done by READ THE MANUAL before execute a thing. Therefore, install man-db for everything.

```sh
doas pacman -S man-db
```

The manual pages are divided into sections provided by respective packages:
1. Section 1 is about *user commands*;
2. section 2 is about *system calls*;
3. section 3 is about *library functions*;
4. section 4 is about *special files*;
5. section 5 is about *file formats*;
6. section 6 is about *games*;
7. section 7 is about *conventions, standards, and miscellaneous*;
8. section 8 is about *system administration and privileged commands*;
9. section 9 is about *Linux kernel API*.

The following command will open the manual page for man's *user command*.

```sh
man 1 man
```

### Arch User Repository Helper

The main reason to install an AUR helper is for ease-of-use rationale. First, install git as privileged user.

```sh
doas pacman -S git
```

Install an AUR helper. [Paru](https://github.com/Morganamilo/paru) is the second AUR helper that captured my heart.

```sh
pushd /tmp/ && \
git clone --depth 1 https://aur.archlinux.org/paru.git

pushd paru/ && \
makepkg -si

popd && popd
```

### A Getty

Prompt for the login password is usual, but it is useless if there is only one unprivileged user. Configure agetty to
login automatically.

```sh
doas nano /etc/conf.d/agetty.tty1
```

Pass these arguments to the agetty_options variable. The options are described in section 8 of agetty manual.

```
...

# extra options to pass to agetty for this port
agetty_options="-J -n -a YOUR_USER"
```

### Optimal OpenRC

Remove unnecessary OpenRC services, and ensure D-Bus is initiated at the default runlevel for sane environment.

```sh
doas rc-update del net.lo default
doas rc-update del net.lo boot
doas rc-update del netmount default
doas rc-update del local nonetwork
doas rc-update add dbus default
```

### ZRAM as a Swap

Create a compressed block device in RAM with on-the-fly disk compression as a swap. First, load the zram kernel module
before creating a block device.

```sh
doas sh -c 'echo zram > /etc/modules-load.d/zram.conf'
```

Create a udev rule with disksize attribute correspond to the real RAM capacity. This ensures the RAM usability is
optimized within.

```sh
doas nano /etc/udev/rules.d/99-zram.rules
```

The udev rule should looks like this.

```
ACTION=="add", KERNEL=="zram0", ATTR{initstate}=="0", ATTR{comp_algorithm}="zstd", ATTR{disksize}="8G", RUN="/usr/bin/mkswap -U clear %N"
```

Add zram block device to `/etc/fstab` file to mount at boot with higher than the default priority.

```sh
doas nano /etc/fstab
```

The appended content of `/etc/fstab` file should looks like this.

```
...

# /dev/zram0
/dev/zram0 none swap defaults,discard,pri=100 0 0
```

Optimize swap paramaters to take full potential of the zram advantages.

```sh
doas nano /etc/sysctl.d/99-vm-zram-parameters.conf
```

The swap parameters should looks like this.

```
vm.swappiness = 180
vm.watermark_boost_factor = 0
vm.watermark_scale_factor = 125
vm.page-cluster = 0
```

### User Directories

Install xdg-user-dirs in order to create the user-specific data directories such as Documents or Downloads by executing
xdg-user-dirs-update. Install BtrFS userspace utility or btrfs-progs in case to maintain your BtrFS volumes too.

```sh
doas pacman -S xdg-user-dirs btrfs-progs
```
```sh
xdg-user-dirs-update
```

Recently created directories shall be pointed as a mount directory of BtrFS subvolumes that already created before.

```sh
doas nano /etc/fstab
```

The appended content of `/etc/fstab` file should looks like this.

```
...

# /dev/nvme0n1p3
PARTUUID=a429b7f1-7541-4a1b-bff8-ccaa1445d13c /media/Butter btrfs rw,noatime,autodefrag,commit=15,compress-force=zstd:7 0 0

PARTUUID=a429b7f1-7541-4a1b-bff8-ccaa1445d13c /home/YOUR_USER/Videos btrfs rw,noatime,subvol=/Videos 0 0

...
```

### Reboot Now

Reboot the system

```sh
doas reboot
```

and ensure to boot to "Artix Linux-Zen". After successfully boot and login, we can use zramctl and findmnt to verify our
recent configuration.

```sh
zramctl
```
```sh
findmnt
```

#### A.x Presence Theme

On wayland, themes such as GTK+ and cursors are set by gsettings schemas. Whereas on legacy X11, GTK communicates to
XSETTINGS daemon. Download your preferred themes and use gsettings to set all presence themes.

```sh
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme 'Graphite-teal-Dark'
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface icon-theme 'Papirus-Dark'
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface cursor-theme 'Phinger Cursors (dark)'
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface font-name 'Cantarell 11'
```

Ensure your preferred font is installed and install noto fonts to fill missing characters as a complete fallback.

```sh
doas pacman -S cantarell-fonts noto-fonts noto-fonts-cjk noto-fonts-emoji noto-fonts-extra --needed
```
